            <ul>
                <li><strong>Certifications:</strong> Research has shown that having official SAP certifications correlates with a 15-25% increase in compensation, and specialist certifications in newer technologies such as S/4HANA, result in even higher compensation premiums. Having multiple certifications certainly demonstrates versatility as well as a strong commitment to continuous learning.</li>
                <li><strong>Industry Expertise:</strong> With the right SAP certifications, specializing in the oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, or manufacturing industries is likely to result in higher compensation because working with these industries comes with complex business and regulatory challenges.</li>
                <li><strong>Geographic Location:</strong> Services may offer clients or customers in tech areas like San Francisco, New York, and Seattle, and in India, like Bangalore, Pune, and Hyderabad, with whom they can integrate advanced services. These locations may offer higher salaries, but also have higher living costs. Remote work has sort of simplified address-based inequities.</li>
                <li><strong>Company Size:</strong> Larger companies provide more opportunity to offer better compensation, benefits and career growth to their employees, than do smaller companies.</li>
                <li><strong>Additional Skills:</strong> Better salaries are offered to consultants that have specialized certifications, such as PMP, Prince2, and have added learning and skills in Cloud Computing, Analytics, and adjacent technologies like AI, Machine Learning, and Advanced Analytics.</li>
                <li><strong>Contract vs. Permanent:</strong> Experience consultants with contracting usually earn higher short-term rates, as contracted consultants typically earn 20 to 40 percent more than permanent employees, but do it without benefits and job certainty.</li>
            </ul>
