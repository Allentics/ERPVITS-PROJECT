Creating a sap modules list will help businesses understand how they can optimize their processes.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">What are SAP Modules?</h2>
            <p>
                SAP modules are system components that specialize in specific business processes within an organization. Each module functions independently yet integrates with other modules, creating a single system, with no data silos and an uninterrupted stream of information between every department. Each module has its own distinct capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                With such a large number of modules, SAP is able to help organizations in implementing modules that are most relevant to their business. This ability to selectively implement modules helps optimize the ERP investment based on business priorities and growth trajectories.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">SAP Functional Modules: The Core of Business Operations</h2>
            <p>
                SAP functional modules are described as the building blocks of SAP ERP systems since they cover the essential parts of the business: finance, logistics, distribution, and personnel management. These modules are tailored for end-users and business process owners, who are responsible for the daily business activities and do not possess a high level of technical understanding.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">SAP FI Module (Financial Accounting)</h3>
            <p>
                The sap fi module is the financial ''brain'' of any given company. It takes care of all the accounting transactions as well as all the financial reporting, ensuring adherence to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and providing a constantly updated snapshot of the company''s financial standing.
            </p>
            <p>Key functionalities of the sap fi module include:</p>
            <ul>
