✅ SAP Certified Trainers ✅ 4.8 Learner Rating ✅ 24/7 Team Support ✅ 15+ Years ABAP Development Experience

Our SAP ABAP on HANA Online Training is delivered exclusively by certified SAP developers with 15+ years of direct ABAP development experience on S/4HANA, cloud platforms, and enterprise applications. Unlike passive video courses or self-paced modules, you receive interactive, real-time instruction where instructors share proven development methodologies, address your specific questions, and guide you through complex coding scenarios step-by-step.

Certified Instructor Expertise: Each trainer holds official SAP certifications and has successfully developed multiple enterprise-scale ABAP applications on HANA, managing millions of database operations daily. They don''t just teach syntax; they share real-world development war stories, performance optimization techniques learned through production implementations, and industry best practices from actual client deployments.

100% Hands-On Learning Methodology: Traditional training teaches ABAP through theory and presentations. Our program goes further. Every session includes live coding demonstrations on SAP HANA environments, followed by guided coding labs where you replicate what you''ve learned. By the end of the course, you''ve developed complete applications, optimized database queries, created FIORI interfaces, implemented web services, managed debugging, and executed end-to-end development workflows.

Job-Oriented Curriculum Design: The course curriculum is designed around the exact skills, responsibilities, and problem-solving scenarios you''ll face as an ABAP developer. Whether you''re building new features, optimizing legacy code, or developing cloud applications, the training ensures you''re equipped with practical development skills.

Interactive Q&A Sessions: Beyond the main classroom instruction, you have dedicated Q&A forums and live office hours where instructors address your doubts, clarify complex topics like database optimization and framework patterns, and provide personalized guidance tailored to your learning pace and career goals.

Flexible Batch Timings: Recognizing that many professionals juggle jobs, families, and learning, we offer both weekday evening batches (6 PM – 9 PM IST) and weekend batches (Saturday & Sunday). Sessions are recorded, so if you miss a live class, you can catch up asynchronously without losing continuity.

Small Batch Sizes for Personalized Attention: Unlike massive online courses with thousands of anonymous learners, our batches are capped at 8-10 participants. This ensures instructors can provide individualized attention, review your code, and offer targeted feedback on your development practices.

Placement & Career Support: Learning ABAP is only half the journey—getting placed is the goal. Our dedicated career support team helps you build an impactful ABAP-focused resume with portfolio projects, prepare through mock technical interviews, and practice with real-world coding challenges from recent hiring trends.

Active Alumni Network & Community Forum: Join a thriving community of ABAP developers. Exchange coding techniques, share optimization strategies, discuss architecture challenges, ask questions, and build professional relationships that can lead to code reviews, collaborations, and referrals.

Ongoing Support Post-Training: Your learning journey doesn''t end with course completion. For six months after training, you''ll continue to receive instructor guidance—whether you need help with code reviews, troubleshooting production issues, or seeking advice during your first ABAP development roles.

ERPVITS has established itself as a trusted training partner for SAP Technical Modules, with hundreds of successful learners working at top technology companies, consulting firms, and SAP development centers like SAP Labs, Accenture, Capgemini, Infosys, Wipro, and Microsoft.

From pre-evaluation to post-training support, we guide you through every step of your SAP ABAP development learning journey and career transition.
