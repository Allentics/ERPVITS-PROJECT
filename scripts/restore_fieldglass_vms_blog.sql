            <p>
                One of the most important modern business challenges is the management of an external workforce. Employers today engage contract employees, freelancers, external service providers, and third-party vendors more than ever before. Managing this complex ecosystem of external resources requires the use of Vendor Management Systems (VMS). However, not all VMS are equally effective. This is the reason SAP Fieldglass is the best solution in the market today.

            <h2>Traditional VMS: What They Typically Offer</h2>
            <p>
                Traditional Vendor Management Systems were designed mainly for rudimentary vendor management and procurement processes. These systems were designed to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Capture vendor information</li>
                <li>Process purchase orders</li>
                <li>Manage invoice and payment administration</li>
                <li>Manage vendor performance</li>
                <li>Keep track of compliance documents</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                While these processes are necessary, traditional VMS systems are ill-equipped to deal with the complexities of today''s workforce.

            <h3>Challenges of Traditional VMS Systems</h3>

                    <h4 class="!mt-0 font-bold">No Visibility</h4>
                    <p class="text-sm">Traditional systems do not provide role-based dashboards or report on data in real-time.</p>
                </div>

                    <p class="text-sm">There are many processes in the system, such as approvals, vendor onboarding and vendor assessments, which are all handled manually and are error-prone.</p>
                </div>

                    <p class="text-sm">These systems work in isolation and do not integrate well with the HR, finance or ERP systems.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="bg-slate-50 p-6 rounded-xl border border-slate-200">
                    <h4 class="!mt-0 font-bold">Insufficient Workforce Management</h4>
                    <p class="text-sm">Traditional VMS systems were not designed to accommodate the contemporary workforce, such as freelancers, contractors or gig workers.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                This is the reason why companies are adopting more sophisticated, cloud-based systems such as SAP Fieldglass.

            </p>

            <h2>SAP Fieldglass vs Traditional VMS: Key Differences</h2>

            <h3>(A) End-to-End External Workforce Management</h3>
            <p>Traditional VMS platforms mostly support vendor data and POs.</p>
            <p><strong>SAP Fieldglass supports the entire lifecycle:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Job posting & sourcing</li>
                <li>Candidate shortlisting</li>
                <li>Onboarding & timesheet tracking</li>
                <li>Worker performance</li>
                <li>Offboarding</li>
                <li>Payment consolidation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With such an extensive workflow, it makes Fieldglass even more trustworthy and scalable.</p>

            <h3>(B) Advanced Analytics & Real-Time Insights</h3>
            <p>Reports within a traditional VMS are stagnant and require manual intervention.</p>
            <p><strong>SAP Fieldglass has things like:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Real-time dashboards</li>
                <li>Spend analytics</li>
                <li>Vendor performance</li>
                <li>Automated compliance</li>
                <li>Predictive analytics</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With the right visibility, intelligence, and data deep analytics, the democratisation of decision-making is achieved at a greater speed and accuracy.</p>

            <h3>(C) Improved Compliance and Risk Management</h3>
            <p>Keeping track of vendor contracts, licenses, background checks, and employee regulations can become very complicated to manage.</p>
            <p><strong>SAP Fieldglass has functions that automate compliance for:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Worker classification</li>
                <li>Alerts for document expiry</li>
                <li>Tracking of documents for compliance</li>
                <li>Automation of legal compliance</li>
                <li>Reports that are ready for audit</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Legacy systems are unable to provide this level of control.</p>

            <h3>(D) Effortless Integration and Other Systems</h3>
            <p>Where legacy VMS tools have been used on their own, SAP Fieldglass has the ability to work with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>SAP S/4HANA</li>
                <li>SAP SuccessFactors</li>
                <li>SAP Ariba</li>
                <li>HRIS systems</li>
                <li>Financial systems and ERP systems</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This provides the whole enterprise with one platform.</p>

            <h3>(E) Enhanced User Experience</h3>
            <p>Older VMS tools also have systems with outdated interface technology.</p>
            <p><strong>SAP Fieldglass has:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Modern and clean interface</li>
                <li>Access that is cloud-based</li>
                <li>Functions that are mobile friendly</li>
                <li>Quick movement through the system and work processes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This leads to shortened training time and greater system uptake by groups.</p>

            <h3>(F) Automation First Strategy</h3>
            <p><strong>SAP Fieldglass has seamless automation for:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Job advertisements</li>
                <li>Onboarding of new workers</li>
                <li>Approvals of timesheets</li>
                <li>Generation of invoices</li>
                <li>Scorecards for vendors</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This increases efficiency and saves an enormous amount of time when compared with legacy systems.</p>
