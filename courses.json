If you miss a live class, you can catch up on the recorded sessions at your own pace.\n\nSmall Batch Sizes for Personalized Attention: Our participants get individual attention. Capped at 8-10 members, we ensure you each get to know the instructor, and they get to know you, your strengths and weaknesses, and provide you with individual attention on complex financial scenarios.\n\nPlacement & Career support: Learning SAP TRM is 50% of the work, and being placed is the other half. To get you ready for interviews, we have real treasury and banking interview questions, help you with mock interviews, and guide you in SAP-focused resume building. You also get support on how to effectively present your project experience during SAP TRM financial services interviews to help you stand out.\n\nActive Alumni Network & Community Forum: Active Alumni Network & Community Forum: Experience building a network within a community of SAP TRM and treasury technology specialists. Provide and receive career-related assistance, pose queries, and establish connections that can provide referrals and partnerships within global financial institutions.\n\nOngoing support Post-Training: Your learning journey doesn't end with SAP TRM course completion. For six months after training, you'll continue to receive instructor guidance—whether you need help clarifying treasury concepts, troubleshooting real-world financial project challenges, or seeking advice during your first TRM consulting engagements.\n\nSince our establishment as a training partner for SAP financial modules, ERPVITS has received positive referrals from learners that have gone on to work for top consulting companies such as Accenture, Capgemini, Deloitte, Infosys, Wipro, and leading financial institutions.

SAP Systems are made available for each training session and each participant completes the corresponding hands-on lab exercises in SAP Systems after each live demonstration. At the conclusion of the program, each participant will be confident in completing all the steps necessary to create a customer sales order, configure a pricing strategy, process a shipment, execute a billing prompt, manage customer relations, and all the customer sales order scenarios taught with real enterprise software.\n\nJob-Oriented Curriculum Design: This approach to design and deliver the curriculum is based on real life situations and not academic theory.

Our dedicated career support team assists you in developing SAP-centric resumes, guides you with mock interviews, and prepares you with relevant interview questions that reflect current hiring trends. You will also get tips to effectively communicate your project experience in SAP SD interviews to help you get noticed during the interviews.\n\nActive Alumni Network & Community Forum: You will become part of a strong professional community of SAP SD and sales operations colleagues. We help you cultivate professional ties for collaboration, job posting and referrals.\n\nOngoing support Post-Training: Your learning journey doesn’t end with the SAP SD course.

    "description": "The SAP ABAP Training offered by ERPVITS is a game changer for ABAP developers and SAP consultants interested in advancing their skills in cloud application development, contemporary programming, and enterprise software. In a cutting-edge business era, organizations demand certified SAP ABAB on cloud experts as proficient in cloud-native application development, ABAP Cloud runtime application, implementing clean architecture patterns, and digital transformation initiatives. This fully-fledged and comprehensive SAP ABAP on Cloud training features live, interactive instructor training, hands-on labs, cloud development projects, and comprehensive certification geared towards development and implementation for ABAP developers, technical consultants, application architects, cloud specialists, and fresh graduates and is focused on global consulting and implementation positions.\n\n[Book Your Free Demo Class] | [View Curriculum]\n\n✅ SAP Certified Trainers ✅ 4.7 Learner Rating ✅ 24/7 Team support\n\nOur SAP ABAP on Cloud online training curriculum is delivered only by certified SAP professionals, each with 12+ years of direct hands-on ABAP programming training along with cloud application modernization experience. Instead of passive video courses with self-paced modules, you get live, real-time training with interactive sessions, hands-on approaches where trainers share industry-proven methodologies, answer your questions, and walk you through difficult cloud development steps in a rational manner.\n\nCertified Instructor Expertise: Each Trainer is certified and holds official SAP ABAP cloud certification credentials, having successfully delivered and executed multiple enterprise-scale cloud application modernizations by innovatively modernizing existing ABAP systems. They don't just teach the theory; they provide cloud deployment case studies, industry-accepted common pitfalls, and best practices that you will find in practice even during your first SAP ABAP developer course consulting engagement. This is the true industry perspective that is always missing.\n\n100% Hands-On Learning Methodology: Conventional training focuses on SAP ABAP concepts with slides and presentations. Our ABAP course takes a step further. Each training session is accompanied by a live presentation on SAP BTP ABAP Environment and a guided lab where you practice what you saw. By the end of the program, you will have been able to build RESTful applications, perform ABAP Cloud RAP implementations, build OData services, develop UIs, and deploy cloud applications on real cloud systems.\n\nIndustry-Relevant Curriculum: The SAP ABAP course content is not theoretical. It mirrors the skills, functions, and the level of responsibility you need to develop and the real-life problem-solving challenges you will face. Whether you are cloud-native applications, modernizing code with ABAP legacy, implementing clean architecture, or solving cloud issues, the program positions you with actionable skills.\n\nConstructive Q&A Sessions: In addition to the primary instruction, the program includes dedicated Q&A forums and live office hours where the program instructors answer your questions and explain advanced development issues. They also outline individualized strategies to help you meet your vision and enhance your ABAP learning experience.\n\nFlexible Batch Timings: Understanding that ABAP developers are likely balancing complex work, family, and education commitments, we provide weekday evening (6 PM – 9 PM IST) and weekend (Saturday & Sunday) options. Since sessions are recorded, we allow asynchronous participation in case you miss a live class. This is to ensure smooth and uninterrupted progress in the SAP ABAP training online course.\n\nSmall Batch Sizes for Personalized Attention: Our approach is to prioritize community learning. This is why we cap class sizes to 8–10 participants, a stark contrast to huge online programs, where learners remain anonymous in the thousands. This means that the teachers can learn your name and your unique situation and provide the necessary scaffolding in complex cloud development.\n\nPlacement & Career support: Learning SAP ABAP on Cloud is a means to an end, and we believe that end must be a placement. Our career support renders real value by working with learners to build an SAP targeted resume and helping with mock interviews relevant to the current market with real interview questions, and offering interview prep focused on cloud modernization to position candidates for ABAP on HANA certification and ABAP on Cloud key offers.\n\nActive Alumni Network & Community Forum: Become part of a community of SAP ABAP on Cloud developers and professionals working with the cloud. Participate in professional exchanges, job referrals, and collaboration. The community forum enables seamless sharing, networking, and support.\n\nPost-Training Ongoing support: Learning does not stop after completing the SAP ABAP full course as you have six months of post-training support with your instructor. You will be able to reach out for assistance with clarifying theories, overcoming challenges with real world cloud projects, or guidance during your initial cloud development consulting projects. You will be able to reach out to your instructor for support during your post-training support period to clarify cloud consulting development theories, troubleshoot complex real world projects, or query during your initial engagements.\n\nERPVITS has proven to be a reliable SAP ABAP training institute for SAP cloud technologies, with many successful learners employed by leading consulting firms including Accenture, Capgemini, Deloitte, Infosys, and Wipro.\n\nWe assist you on every part of your SAP ABAP on Cloud online training learning and transition to a Cloud ABAP career, from pre-evaluation to after training.\n\nComprehensive, career-related SAP ABAP training comprises live sessions with experts, cloud development projects, labs, career support, and other elements to ensure you are ready to work as an SAP ABAP on Cloud developer.\n\nLive Interactive Classes: Participate in weekly sessions with a single instructor for 8–10 weeks to complete 30–35 hours of ABAP online classes with interactive sessions on cloud development. Attendees may ask questions and participate in the development sessions.\n\nReal-world Projects: You will work with case studies inspired by Fortune 500 companies on cloud application modernization, microservices development, RESTful API, and SAP BTP integration.\n\nHands-On Lab Environment: Enjoy full-time access to SAP Business Technology Platform ABAP Environment for the practical application of ABAP Cloud RAP development, OData services, UI implementation, and cloud deployment.\n\nCertification Exam Prep: Acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to successfully take the SAP Certified Development Associate – SAP ABAP Cloud Platform certification exam through comprehensive study guides, practice tests, and concentrated bootcamp training.\n\nResume & Interview Coaching: Build your confidence with personalized resume refinement, tailored mock technical interviews, and SAP ABAP developer training interview coaching.\n\nComplete Study Materials: Enjoy comprehensive study resources including PDFs, presentations, code samples, architecture documents, interview question banks, and links to official SAP resources.\n\nLifetime Recording Access: All live sessions on cloud development are recorded, transcribed, and indexed for easy access, revision, and lifelong retention of essential, actionable information.\n\nExpert Q&A Sessions: Actively participate in weekly 60-minute live sessions, which focus on cloud ABAP development concepts, offering project guidance and career mentoring.\n\n30-35 hours of expert-led training covering every aspect from basics to advanced cloud ABAP development with best SAP ABAP online training practices",
